What is Twit-favs?
==================

Twit-favs is a small and simple aggregator for all your twitter favourite needs. If you're like me, you have lots and lots of favourites that you don't have time to read through. So, much like an RSS reader, this little app displays your favourites in a nice and simple manner and preloads previews of the links (if any) contained within those tweets.

How does one use it?
====================

Well one needs to have a twitter account (if one hasn't got one, please visit: [http://twitter.com/](http://twitter.com/) and sort one self out). Once one is on twitter, visit the app at: [http://twit-favs.appspot.com/](http://twit-favs.appspot.com/) and autherise one's arse. Then one'll be in twitter favourites heaven.
